# ResumeLaTeX:
My resume in LaTeX.
It uses res.cls for templating which was created by Michael DeCorte

## Template:
I created the files within to be fairly easy to adapt for your own resume.  This was done as an easy way for RIT Space Exploration members to create professional looking resumes quickly.  It is really as simple as just replacing my details with your own.

## Using the Template:
The easiest way to use this template is to use Overleaf.  With Overleaf you just need to move the resume.tex and res.cls files to your project.  Then you can replace my information with your own.  There are plenty of examples for styling within the document that you can use.  

## Overleaf Compilation Issues:
If you are getting issues compiling your .pdf file from the template then you should try changing your compiler.  You can do this by clicking the leaf next to the "menu" button in the overleaf UI within your project.  Then you can change your compiler.  The one that I have tested this with is LuaLaTex.
